# n8n Workflow Files

This directory contains exported n8n workflow JSON files for version control.

## Usage

1. Create or modify workflows in the n8n UI
2. Export workflows as JSON from n8n
3. Save the exported JSON files in this directory
4. Commit the files to version control

This ensures workflows are backed up and can be imported to new n8n instances.
